# Project: Simulation


The essence of the project is a step-by-step simulation of a 2D world inhabited by herbivores and predators. In addition to creatures, the world contains resources (grasses) that herbivores feed on, and static objects that cannot be interacted with - they just take up space.

The 2D world is an NxM matrix, each creature or object occupies an entire cell, and the presence of several objects/creatures in a cell is unacceptable.

The project was implemented in accordance with the requirements set out in this course [RoadMap_SergeyZhukov](https://zhukovsd.github.io/java-backend-learning-course/projects/simulation/)
